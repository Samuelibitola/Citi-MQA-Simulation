# Citi Markets Quantitative Analysis (MQA) Simulation

I recently completed Citi's Markets Quantitative Analysis (MQA) virtual experience on Forage. This simulation gave me practical exposure to financial quantitative analysis, hedging strategies, and risk management in commodity markets, using coffee futures as a case study.

## What I Learned

### Task 1: Introduction to Commodity Pricing
- Understood **futures contracts** and how they are used to hedge against price volatility.
- Learned the key factors influencing commodity prices:
  - Supply and demand dynamics
  - Weather patterns
  - Geopolitical factors
  - Macroeconomic indicators
- Gained skills in **analyzing historical data** and predicting potential price movements.

### Task 2: Pricing Coffee Futures
- Applied quantitative techniques to **price coffee futures and options**:
  - **Cost of Carry Model** to calculate fair futures prices
  - **Black-Scholes Model** to price options
  - **Monte Carlo Simulations** to forecast a range of potential outcomes
- Learned how changes in supply, demand, weather, and geopolitical events impact pricing.
- Built an **analytical framework for coffee futures**, incorporating volatility, storage costs, and interest rates.

### Task 3: Hedging and Structuring Securities
- Developed **hedging strategies** using derivatives:
  - **Put and call options** for downside and upside protection
  - **Swaps** for managing interest rate and currency risk
- Structured securities for different client profiles:
  - **Commodity-linked bonds** for conservative investors
  - **Structured notes** for moderate risk takers
  - **Digital options** for high-risk investors
  - **ETFs** for portfolio diversification
- Conducted **quantitative analysis** for scenario planning and risk mitigation.

### Task 4: Managing Risk Across Market Trade Units
- Measured and monitored market risk using:
  - **Value at Risk (VaR)**
  - **Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis**
  - **Sensitivity Analysis**
- Managed **credit risk** using credit scoring models, collateral, and credit default swaps.
- Managed **operational risk** through automation, robust IT infrastructure, audits, and staff training.
- Applied strategies to real-life scenarios, such as hedging against coffee price increases, mitigating supplier credit risk, and reducing trading errors.
